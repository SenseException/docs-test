Test

Requirements
------------

1. Each pull request that adds new or changes the existing logic must have tests.

.. note::

   Modifications to the keyword lists under the ``Doctrine\DBAL\Platforms\Keywords`` namespace
   don't have to be covered with tests.

2. The test that covers certain logic must fail without this logic implemented.
